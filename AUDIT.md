# Audit Notes

## Code Quality
- ShellCheck shows no warnings across scripts and shortcuts.
- `scripts/lint.sh` lacked documentation and dependency checks. Added header comments and a check for `shellcheck`.
- Updated lint, security check and test scripts to use the Termux bash shebang.

## Agents Review
- Existing agents cover linting, documentation, shortcuts, scheduling, optimization, security, API fallback, installer creation, tagging, testing and change tracking.
- Added new **InputSanitizer** agent to ensure strings are escaped before inclusion in JSON payloads and to validate API responses.

## Commit History Insights
- Commit `9185d958` fixed `githelper newrepo` when the repository had no files. This is now prevented by the Tester agent.
- Commit `f9b805f2` fixed prompt quoting in JSON. The new InputSanitizer agent will help catch similar issues automatically.

## Suggested Automation
- Run `scripts/security_check.sh` and `scripts/lint.sh` in CI to catch issues early.
- Extend the Tester agent with cases for `wallai.sh` to validate JSON quoting and API fallback.
